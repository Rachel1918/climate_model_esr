# Climate_model_ESR

The **Climate_Model_ESR** repository hosts a set of Climate Risk Models, which are developed by [ESR](https://www.esr.cri.nz/about-us) using a combination of open-source tools and proprietary in-house solutions. The aim of these models is to assess the impact of climate change on the society and community of New Zealand.

_This project has been funded by ESRâ€™s SSIF platform starting from 2024._
